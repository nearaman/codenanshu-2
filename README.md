## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Blog post.**

    Use the Codenanshu CLI to create a new post, by filling the starter template.

    ```shell
    # use [blog, tutorial, notes] after new to generate template
    npx hygen new blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/aianshume/codenanshu.git
    cd codenanshu
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `codenanshu` directory in your code editor of choice and edit any code. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── content
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .hygen.js
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/content`**: This directory will contain all markdown files of all the post and data in this website and read by gatsby and the nodejs for backend.

3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  **`.hygen.js`**: this file have function to get current date and time in starter template with hygen

6.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

9.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

10. **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

11. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
