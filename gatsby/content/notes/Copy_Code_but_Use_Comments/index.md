## why comments are important in programming
Commenting involves placing Human Readable Descriptions inside of computer programs detailing what the Code is doing. Proper use of commenting can make code maintenance much easier, as well as helping make finding bugs faster. Further, commenting is very important when writing functions that other people will use.

yes copying code is not a problem, but you know what the problem is ??. well if you not comments the documatation and why this code working or anything, there is a big problem here if you open you project after a years then are not able to understand your own code and you are unable to understand the  code which you copy..

so its higly recommanded to comments the name and the source of the code which yo copy from
